Gaëlle Vallée-Tourangeau is a professor of Behavioural Science and Director of Research and Enterprise at Kingston Business School. She studied at Paris Ouest University (1998, MSc Social Psychology) and the University of Hertfordshire (2004, PhD) then was a lecturer at the Leeds University Business School (2001-2004) and the University of Toulouse (2004-2009) before joining Kingston University in 2009.

Her expertise lies in behavioural sciences and her research builds upon scientific reasoning and empirical evidence to explain what motivates human behaviour. She studies people’s choices and decisions as well as how to change behaviour. Her work contributes to better understand what influences decisions and creativity such as information design, the artefacts available in our environment, as well as individual motivational regulation needs such as the need for autonomy.

She has applied behavioural sciences to answer questions such as what motivates healthcare workers to decide to get (or not to get) vaccinated, what motivates knowledge workers to decide to support an application for funding, or how can we boost creative and insightful solutions to problems. She is co-director of the [Behavioural Research Analytics in Neurotechnological Systems (BRAINS) Lab](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/faculties/faculty-of-business-and-social-sciences/research/foresight-creativity/the-brains-lab/), a nationally leading research and innovation facility that pioneers the convergence of behavioural sciences, user experience research and next-generation technologies.

The public outputs from her research includes over 60 journal articles, book chapters, and conference proceedings. Her work has been published in leading psychology journals such as the Journal of Experimental Psychology – Applied, Health Psychology, Psychology and Health, the Journal of Experimental Psychology - General, Psychological Science, Cognition, Memory & Cognition and Acta Psychologica, among others. Her research has been funded by the Fyssen foundation (2004), the French National Research Agency (2008), the Leverhulme Trust (2011), Sanofi-Pasteur (2013), and the Wellcome Trust (2019).
