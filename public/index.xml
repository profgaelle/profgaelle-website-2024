She studied at Paris Ouest University (1998, MSc Social Psychology) and the University of Hertfordshire (2004, PhD) then was a lecturer at the Leeds University Business School (2001-2004) and the University of Toulouse (2004-2009) before joining Kingston University in 2009.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Her expertise lies in behavioural sciences and her research builds upon scientific reasoning and empirical evidence to explain what motivates human behaviour. She studies people’s choices and decisions as well as how to change behaviour. Her work contributes to better understand what influences decisions and creativity such as information design, the artefacts available in our environment, as well as individual motivational regulation needs such as the need for autonomy.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
